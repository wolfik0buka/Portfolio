		"In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, Healing Is Difficult, the following year but was displeased with the promotion of the record. She released her next studio album, Colour the Small One, in 2004, but it struggled to connect with a mainstream audience. Sia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born, were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. She took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"Titanium\" (with David Guetta), \"Diamonds\" (with Rihanna) and \"Wild Ones\" (with Flo Rida).  ",

"In 2014, Sia finally broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, 1000 Forms of Fear, debuted at No 1 in the U.S. Billboard 200 and generated the top-ten single \"Chandelier\" and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer Maddie Ziegler. In 2016, she released her seventh studio album This Is Acting, which spawned her first Hot 100 number one single, \"Cheap Thrills\". The same year, Sia gave her Nostalgic for the Present Tour, which incorporated performance art elements. Sia has received accolades, including ARIA Awards and an MTV Video Music Award.",

"Sia lent her voice to the show South Park in its eighteenth season. In episode 3 entitled \"The Cissy\", she portrayed Lorde in a parody song in the episode entitled \"Push (Feeling Good on a Wednesday)\". The resemblance was so convincing that many viewers thought Lorde had provided the voice in the song. Sia wrote and recorded \"Angel By the Wings\", the title song for the documentary film The Eagle Huntress, which premiered in 2016 at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2016 Sia covered \"Blackbird\" by The Beatles for the Netflix original series Beat Bugs. She appeared in the 2017 animated film My Little Pony: The Movie as the voice of \"pop star\" character Songbird Serenade. She also contributed an original song, \"Rainbow\", to the film's soundtrack."],
